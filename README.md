# Sioux-Falls-network-in-cell-representaion

This Sioux Falls network is adopted from (Han, Ukkusuri, & Doan, 2011). We modified they by installing three fast charging statios.They are No. 590, No. 591 and No. 621 and are equipped with 20, 40 and 20 chargers, respectively. This network consists of 123 cells, 157 links and 6 O-D pairs. 



This example is used in the work: Resilience assessment of an electrified road network subject to charging station failures. If you would like to use this example please cite the following paper:
